      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Studies have shown that methane exposure can have negative impacts on human health, particularly
        for children and young adults. This GIS project raises awareness around potential environmental
        justice concerns by examining the proximity of methane-producing landfills to schools and
        colleges in Los Angeles, and analyzing how income levels intersect with environmental risk.

      <h2>Data Layers Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Schools, Colleges, and Universities</strong> – Contains school level, type, name, address, city, and organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Methane Producing Landfills</strong> – Spatial data identifying the name and location of methane-producing landfills.</li>
        <li><strong>Income per Capita (Census Tracts)</strong> – Census tract data containing income per capita values for the Los Angeles area.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Analysis Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Which schools located in the City of Los Angeles are within <strong>0.5 kilometers</strong> of methane-producing landfills?</li>
        <li>Which census tracts contain these schools, and are they among the <strong>lower 50%</strong> in income per capita?</li>
        <li>What is the <strong>wealthiest census tract</strong> (by income per capita) that contains a landfill?</li>
        <li>What is the <strong>closest methane-producing landfill</strong> to Topeka Charter School for Advanced Studies?</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>GIS Methods Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Select by Attributes</strong> to identify schools located in the City of Los Angeles</li>
        <li><strong>Buffer Analysis</strong> (0.5 km) around methane-producing landfills</li>
        <li><strong>Select by Location</strong> to identify schools within landfill buffer zones</li>
        <li><strong>Spatial Join</strong> to associate schools with census tract income data</li>
        <li><strong>Statistical Classification</strong> to identify census tracts in the lower 50% of income per capita</li>
        <li><strong>Near / Distance Analysis</strong> to determine closest landfill to a selected school</li>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The analysis identified multiple schools located near methane-producing landfills within
        the City of Los Angeles. When intersected with income data, several of these schools were
        found within census tracts that fall in the lower 50 percent of income per capita, highlighting
        potential environmental justice concerns. The analysis found that there are 53 schools located in the city of Los Angeles within 0.5km of a landfill. Those schools fall in 29 census tracts with a median income per capita of $23,674. There are 14 cencus tracts that are in the lower 50 percent of Census Tracts in income_per_capita.
      </p>
      <p class="highlight">
        The wealthiest census track in the City of Los Angeles that has a methane producing landfill is 0603726200 (Bel Air, Los Angeles). That census track has an income per capita of $123,717. If looking at the entire county, the City of Pasadena has the wealthiest census track with a landfill, 06037460800 with an income per capita of $140,171. The closest methane-producing landfill to <strong>Topeka Charter School for Advanced Studies</strong>
        is the <strong>Granada Hills Street Maintenance District Yard</strong>, located slightly over <strong>5,000 feet</strong> away.
