    <p>
        I have a strong passion for <strong>city planning</strong> and <strong>environmental protection</strong>.
        I serve on several task forces and committees focused on environmental issues and civic life.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a problem solver who enjoys working directly with communities.
        As a <strong>Philadelphia resident</strong>, I take great pride in the city and am deeply committed
        to making a meaningful impact on improving the quality-of-life issues faced by residents.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mapping allows me to visualize problems, identify patterns, and guide real-world action.
        Through GIS, I connect data, place, and people to support informed decision-making
        and community-driven solutions.

    <!-- Skill -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0077cc;">Select by Attribute</h3>
        <p>
            Select by Attribute allows features to be selected based on information stored in the
            attribute table, such as population size, land use type, or environmental indicators.
            This skill is important because it enables analysts to filter large datasets and focus
            on specific criteria to answer data-driven questions efficiently.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Skill -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0077cc;">Select by Location</h3>
        <p>
            Select by Location identifies features based on their spatial relationship to other
            features, such as selecting schools within a certain distance of bike lanes or homes
            within a floodplain. This skill is essential because it connects geographic location
            to analysis and helps reveal spatial patterns that impact communities.

    <!-- Skill -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0077cc;">Adding a Join</h3>
        <p>
            Adding a join links external data tables to spatial layers using a shared attribute,
            such as a census tract ID. This is important because it allows non-spatial data to be
            visualized geographically, making trends and relationships easier to interpret.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Skill -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0077cc;">Adding a Buffer</h3>
        <p>
            A buffer creates a zone at a specified distance around geographic features, such as
            a 500-foot radius around schools or a one-mile radius around transit stations.
            Buffers are important for proximity analysis and are widely used in planning,
            environmental protection, and public health studies.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Skill -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0077cc;">Calculate Field</h3>
        <p>
            Calculate Field is used to create or update attribute values using formulas, such as
            calculating population density or creating classification categories. This skill
            is important because it transforms raw data into meaningful information for analysis
            and visualization.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Skill -->
    <div>
        <h3 style="color:#0077cc;">Calculate Geometry</h3>
        <p>
            Calculate Geometry computes spatial measurements such as area, length, or coordinates.
            This skill is critical for accurate spatial analysis and supports real-world
            decision-making in urban planning, environmental studies, and infrastructure projects.
